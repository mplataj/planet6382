			<h2>Anthem</h2>
				<p style="white-space: pre-line">
				The birds they sang
				At the break of day
				Start again
				I heard them say
				Don't dwell on what has passed away
				Or what is yet to be

				Ah, the wars they will be fought again
				The holy dove, she will be caught again
				Bought and sold, and bought again
				The dove is never free

				Ring the bells that still can ring
				Forget your perfect offering
				There is a crack, a crack in everything
				That's how the light gets in

				We asked for signs
				The signs were sent
				The birth betrayed
				The marriage spent
				Yeah, and the widowhood
				Of every government
				Signs for all to see

				I can't run no more
				With that lawless crowd
				While the killers in high places
				Say their prayers out loud
				But they've summoned, they've summoned up
				A thundercloud
				They're going to hear from me

				Ring the bells that still can ring
				Forget your perfect offering
				There is a crack, a crack in everything
				That's how the light gets in

				You can add up the parts
				But you won't have the sum
				You can strike up the march
				There is no drum
				Every heart, every heart
				To love will come
				But like a refugee

				Ring the bells that still can ring
				Forget your perfect offering
				There is a crack, a crack in everything
				That's how the light gets in

				Ring the bells that still can ring
				Forget your perfect offering
				There is a crack, a crack in everything
				That's how the light gets in

				That's how the light gets in
				That's how the light gets in
				</p>
